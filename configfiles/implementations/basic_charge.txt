# ----------------
# Further comments
# ----------------

#  Each agent has the same implementation, e.g. all agents work with a single Wander behavior state
#    when you choose this implementation file.

#  Since the wander behavior is quite simple, there is no need to split up the implementation in multiple behaviors.
#    For this implementation, a single state suffices to implement the wander behavior.

#  In case of more complex implementations, it becomes more desirable to split the behavior up in different states
#    so that the complexity becomes easier to manage.
